Hey folks, it's Anas here and I'd love to welcome you to this repository-the place to learn more about Artificial Intellegince, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and so much more.

This repository is mainly built for learning purposes and will be developed in a very communicative way. Everything will be understandable and intuitive. This is not some repo filled with complex machine learning code, but understandable, commented code! I want to make the learning of AI accessible to everyone for free!

Once again, I welcome you and go have a look at the [table of contents](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-Projects-101#project-contents) and explore the project you want.

If you're looking to contribute then have a look at the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-Projects-101/blob/main/Contributing.md) file. I'd be ever so greatful for your contributions

If you folks want something to improve, feel free and absolutely no hesitation to file an issue! I'd love to make this repository better!

Muhammad Anas üëãüèª
