Hey folks, it's Anas here and I'd love to welcome you to this repository - the place to learn more about Artificial Intellegince, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and so much more.

This repository is mainly built for learning purposes and will be developed in a very communicatave way. Everything will be understandable and intuitive. This is not some repo filled with complex Machine Learning code but understandable, commented code! I want to make the learning of AI accessible to everyone for free!

Once again, I welcome you and go have a look at the [table of contents](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-Projects-101#project-contents) and explore the project you want.

If you're looking to contribute then have a look at the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-Projects-101/blob/main/Contributing.md) file. I'd be ever so greatful for your contributions

If you folks want something to improve, feel free and absolutely no hesitation to file an issue! I'd love to make this repository better!
