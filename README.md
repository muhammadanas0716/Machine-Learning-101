# Machine Learning Projects

Hey Machine Learning fans, we all are aware that Machine Learning is on fire right now. It's everywhere - dominated every industry. From the mobile phone you hold to the mind blowing autonomous cars. So recently I started experimenting & started exploring the vast domain of Machine Learning and I think practicing is the only way to learn effectively, atleast for me. And then learning in public is just so much better and **100x** more effective! So what better way to start...solving Machine Learning problems in public. So I want everyone out there to participate here!

I also have another repository dedicated to **Data Analysis**, which can be found [here](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Data-Science-Projects---EDA). In that repository, I focus on **Data Analysis** only and don't talk about **Machine Learning**, but this repository is all about it! Not to forget, 

> I'll still be doing **Explortory Data Analysis** on a dataset before applying Machine Learning algorithms. 

I have great projects on my mind, and the first project I'm going to start with is a **Heart Disease Classification** problem. A fairly simple one, but a very good start. I'll also move towards towards **Deep Learning** projects, gradually ofcourse as I'm still learning, fortunately we all are, so have a look below!

Would love to see your Project Suggestions!

## Learning & Contribution
Well, this is the fun part and the main point of this repository is to learn. I believe practice **will** make me a much better Machine Learning engineer, and hopefully you will too. So...

I've made this repo open to contributions! If there's a Machine Learning project you want to here, you can feel free to create an issue with your project details, I'd love to tackle it! And ofcourse if anyone else wants to tackle it - you surely can, I'll be ever so grateful!

Just go through the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-Projects-101/blob/main/Contributing.md) to get familiar with the process. Trust me, it's not long!
