Hey ML fam! Up for a new project? Today, we'll be predicting some avocado prices! It is a well-known fact that Millenials LOVE Avocado Toast. It's also a well-known fact that all Millenials live in their parent's basements.

Clearly, they aren't buying a home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast!

But maybe there's hope… if a Millenial could find a city with cheap avocados, they could live out the Millenial American Dream.

# About Data
This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV. Here's how the [Hass Avocado Board describes the data on their website](http://www.hassavocadoboard.com/retail/volume-and-price-data):

The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar, and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLUs) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

# Evaluation
This project is fairly simple, we'll use some measures like RMSE and similar to these metrics.

As this is just a dataset (And not a Kaggle competition), we'll take 0.2% of our data as our test set, and the rest shall be our training set.

# Introduction
Greetings, Machine Learning enthusiasts! Are you ready for a new project? Today, we'll be delving into the prediction of avocado prices. As we all know, millennials have a strong affinity for Avocado Toast. However, with the high prices of avocados, many millennials find themselves unable to afford purchasing a home. But what if there was a way for them to find a city with affordable avocados? That's where we come in.

# About Data
We'll be working with a dataset that was collected from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018. The data is a compilation of weekly retail scan data for national retail volume and price, obtained directly from retailers' cash registers. It includes information from multiple channels such as grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar, and military. The dataset only includes data on Hass avocados and represents a per unit cost.

# Evaluation
To evaluate our predictions, we'll be using metrics such as RMSE and others. For the purpose of this project, we'll use 20% of the data as our test set and the rest will be used as our training set.

# Contribution
I would love and welcome any contributions or suggestions to improve the accuracy of our predictions. Feel free to share your thoughts via a **Pull Request** or an **Issue**. Let's work together to help millennials achieve the Millennial American Dream!
