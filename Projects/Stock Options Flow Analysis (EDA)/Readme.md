# Live Options Flow EDA Project

This project is based on analyzing live options flow data obtained from [tradytics.com](tradytics.com/live-options-flow). The data is up-to-date as of **6th February 2023**.
Learning Outcomes

By conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the live options flow data, the following insights were gained:

1. A deeper understanding of the relationships and patterns within options flow data.
2 A better grasp on the tools and techniques used for analyzing large datasets.
3. Improved ability to identify and interpret meaningful insights from data.

## Major Questions Answered

The following questions were answered through this project's EDA:

1. What are the relationships between different options flow metrics?
2. What are the common patterns observed in options flow data over time?
3. How does options flow vary across different stocks and stock sectors?
