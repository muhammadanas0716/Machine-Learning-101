Just start! Nothing else to do. Just follow the following steps and you're ready to get your project merged here, helping many ML devs out there!

Please note this repository has a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

# How to Contribute
You have a Machine Learning related problem in mind? If yes you could just go ahead and file an issue and very soon it'll be included in this repository. However, if you want to tackle a Machine Learing project yourself, then go ahead have a look at the existing [issues](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-Projects-101/issues), but if there is a project you want to build and it's not in the issues - then create an issue yourself and get coding.

First and foremost, fork this repository and clone it your computer/local machine. Once done then do the following changes:

  1. Create a folder dedicated to your project (i.e Titanic from Disaster).
  2. In the folder, there should be the dataset files, the notebook and the compiled model. By complied model I mean saved model which can be done with the help of **Joblib** or **Pickle**.
  3. Update the **Table of Contents** in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Machine-Learning-Projects-101/blob/main/README.md) file.

Once you're done updating everything at your end on your forked repository, you can send a PR to this project and I'll be more than happy to merge it!

#### Am Eagerly Waiting for your PR 👋🏻
